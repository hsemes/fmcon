                        contends that the decision of the trial court in this case to abstain was
                        improper because the case was one which arose under the Constitution.&nbsp;He
                        argues that only national courts have legal authorization to make rulings
                        in such a case. &nbsp;He bases this argument upon the pertinent
                        jurisdictional language of the Constitution, because it makes no reference

                        because it requires a state court in a case involving a "substantial

                    <div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;First, that interpretation cannot be reconciled with the trial court's actions. &nbsp;If the trial court was indeed upholding the state's claim of sovereign immunity, and did not consider it necessary to determine whether this lack of redress constituted a violation of Mr. Gimnang's constitutional rights of due process, this would have amounted to a final judgment. &nbsp;An acceptance of the state's sovereign immunity claim would have called for a denial of recovery as to the pre-November 25, 1986 taxes and would have left nothing further to be considered. &nbsp;Thus, the trial court's action in abstaining as to the claim for recovery of the pre-November 25, 1986 taxes reflected a view that some claim remained. &nbsp;This cannot be reconciled with a reading of the trial court's opinion as upholding the state's claim of sovereign immunity.</FONT></div>

                    <div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our review of the state constitutional language at issue makes us highly skeptical of the proposition that the trial court saw the issue of sovereign immunity as so clearcut that it could be resolved in the one sentence quoted above. &nbsp;The state points to the following language of <A href="../../../yap/constitution/article2.htm">article II</A>, section 12 of the Yap Constitution as an assertion of sovereignty: &nbsp;"Every person may sue for redress, as provided by law, from the State or public entity in case that person had suffered damage through an illegal act of any public official."</FONT></div>

                    <div><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The state contends that this provision means that the state may not be sued unless legislation specifically authorizing suit is enacted.</FONT></div>
