The Constitution vests the nat'l gov't with power to act concerning health care and may place some affirmative health care obligations on it. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol1/1fsm161_173.htm"><I><U>Manahane v. FSM</U></I>, 1 FSM Intrm. 161</A>, 172 (Pon. 1982).</FONT></div>

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">
The Professional Services Clause of the Constitution demands that when any part of the nat'l gov't contemplates action that may be anticipated to affect the availability of education, health care or legal services, the nat'l officials involved must consider the right of the people to such services and make a reasonable effort to take "every step reasonable and necessary" to avoid unnecessarily reducing the availability of the services. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol4/4fsm017_031.htm"><I>Carlos

<br>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Since Congress did not give any consideration to, or make any mention of, the services enumerated in art. XIII, § 1 of the FSM Constitution in enacting the Foreign Investment Act, 32 FSMC 201-232, the avoidance of potential conflict with the Constitution calls for the conclusion that Congress did not intend the Foreign Investment Act to apply to noncitizen attorneys or to any other persons who provide services of the kind described in art. XIII, § 1 of the Constitution. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol4/4fsm017_031.htm"><U><I><U>Carlos v. FSM</U></I></U>, 4 FSM

Since the Constitution's Professional Services Clause is a promise that the nat'l gov't will take every step "reasonable and necessary" to provide health care to its citizens, a court should not lightly accept a contention that 6 FSMC 702(4), which creates a $20,000 ceiling of governmental liability, shields the gov't against a claim that FSM gov't negligence prevented a person from receiving necessary health care. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol4/4fsm350_366.htm"><I><U>Leeruw v.

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Read in the light of its legislative history, art. XIII, § 5 of the FSM Constitution was intended to cover leases, not easements, and therefore an easement that is indefinite in term does not violate this constitutional section. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol3/3fsm324_331.htm"><I><U>Melander v. Kosrae</U></I>, 3 FSM Intrm. 324</A>, 330 (Kos. S. Ct. Tr. 1988).</FONT></div>

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The &nbsp;FSM Constitution terminated all existing indefinite term land use agreements five years after the effective date of the Constitution. &nbsp;After that date, without a new lease agreement the occupier becomes a trespasser on the land. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol5/5fsm130_138.htm"><I><U>Billimon v.

<br>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Easements are not indefinite land use agreements prohibited by the Constitution because "indefinite land use agreement" is a term of art referring to Trust Territory leases for an indefinite term. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol5/5fsm417_425.htm"><I><U>Nena v.

<br>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Land granted for "for so long as it is used for missionary purposes," is not a constitutionally prohibited indefinite land use agreement because the length of the term of the land use will continue, with all certainty, as long as a court determines that the land is still being used for missionary purposes. &nbsp;The term is definite, because its termination can be determined with certainty. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol6/6fsm199_203.htm"><I><U>Dobich v.

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">An easement for a road is not an indefinite land use agreement prohibited by the Constitution because it is perpetual. &nbsp;It is not indefinite in that it is effective into perpetuity. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol6/6fsm251_256.htm"><I><U>Nena v.

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">An easement may be created for a permanent duration, or, as it is sometimes stated, in fee, which will ordinarily continue in operation and be enforceable forever. &nbsp;The grant of a permanent easement is for as definite a term as the grant of a fee simple estate. &nbsp;Both are permanent and not for a definite term. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol6/6fsm437_440.htm"><I><U>Nena v.
