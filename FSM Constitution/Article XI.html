the meaning of the words in the FSM Constitution are not self-evident and it is
apparent the words have been drawn from or are patterned upon language in the

discerning the appropriate meaning of the words in the FSM Constitution.

authorizing departures from those standards only to impose tighter standards,

due process protections against biased decision-making in judicial proceedings
