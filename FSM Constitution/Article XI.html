decisions of United States courts are not binding upon the FSM Supreme Court as
to the meaning of the FSM Constitution even when the words of the FSM
Constitution plainly are based upon comparable language in the U.S.

which 1) was shaped by historical factors not relevant to the FSM; 2) was widely
and persuasively criticized by commentators in the U.S.; and 3) was not
specifically recognized or even alluded to by the framers of the FSM

authorizing departures from those standards only to impose tighter standards,
