Topeka</U>, 20 Wall. 655 (1875);<U>Carmichael v. Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co.</U>, 300 U.S. 644 (1937). &nbsp;(2) &nbsp;If the government has the power to regulate, the court next asks if what the statute &nbsp;proposes to do bears a rational relationship to the implementation of the legislative goal. &nbsp;Another way of asking the same question is, "Can any reasonable&nbsp;legislature choose this particular statute to&nbsp;achieve its goal?" &nbsp;In subjecting a statute to this second test, it must be pointed out that the statute is presumed to be valid. &nbsp;The challengers of the statute must bear the burden of proving that the statute is devoid of any rational basis. &nbsp;Additionally, with respect to economic measures, the courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.<U> Munn v. Illinois</U>, 94 U.S. 113 (1877); <U>Ferguson v.

Where relevant differences exist between classes, different treatment by the state is permissible. &nbsp;Additionally, the state has inherent power to prescribe regulations to promote the health, peace, morals, education and good order of the people and to legislate so as to increase the industries of the state, develop its resources and add to its wealth and prosperity. &nbsp;Regulations for these purpose are not designed to impose unequal restrictions upon anyone, but to promote the general good with as little individual inconvenience as possible.</FONT></div>

                        useful point of reference. &nbsp;In Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 
                        105, 54 S. Ct. 330, 332, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934), the court referred to a 
                        fundamental right as "some principle of justice so rooted in the 
                        traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental." 
                        &nbsp;In a famous concurring opinion, controversial because of its 
                        expansiveness, Justice Goldberg said, "In determining which rights are 
                        fundamental, judges are not left at large to decide cases in light of 
                        their personal and private notions." &nbsp;Rather, they must look to the 
                        "traditions and collective conscience of our people to determine whether a 
                        principle is so rooted there as to be ranked as fundamental. &nbsp;The 
                        inquiry is whether a right involved is of such a character that it cannot 
                        be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and 
                        justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions. 
                        &nbsp;Liberty also gains content from the emanations of specific 
                        constitutional guarantees and from experience with the requirements of a 
                        free society." &nbsp;Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 493, 85 S. Ct. 
                        1678, 1686-87, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510, 520 (1965).</FONT></DIV>

                            is noteworthy also that statutes abolishing such claims have been held

                            Convention's Committee on Civil Liberties anticipated that application of 
                            the <A href="../../constitution/article4.htm">due process clause in the FSM Constitution</A> would be similar to that of 
                            the United States. &nbsp;It is therefore of interest that the United 
                            States courts have consistently held that the due process clause poses 
                            little if any impediment to the abolition of a common law right of action. 
                            &nbsp;It has been said that "a person has no property, no vested interest,

                            common law to attain a permissible legislative object." &nbsp;Silver v.
