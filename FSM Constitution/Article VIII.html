<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Power to regulate probate of wills or inheritance of property is not "beyond the power of a state to control" within meaning of art. VIII, § 1 of Constitution and is consequently a state power. &nbsp;Nothing about the power to regulate probate of wills or inheritance of property suggests that these are beyond the power of a state to control. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol1/1fsm097_113.htm"><I><U>In re Nahnsen</U></I>, 1 FSM Intrm. 97</a>, 107 (Pon. 1982).</FONT></div>

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">State officials generally should have greater knowledge of use, local custom and expectations concerning land and personal property. &nbsp;They should be better equipped than nat'l gov't to control and regulate these matters. &nbsp;Framers of Constitution specifically considered this issue and felt that powers of this sort should be state powers. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol1/1fsm097_113.htm"><I><U>In re Nahnsen</U></I>, 1 FSM Intrm. 97</a>, 107, 109 (Pon. 1982).</FONT></div>

While Congress and the states may eventually wish to allocate their respective roles with more precision, the current Weapons Control Act appears to provide a workable system during these early years of transition and constitutional self-government. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol2/2fsm038_048.htm"><I><U>Joker v.

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36px"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Major crimes obviously were not viewed by framers as simply a local or state problem. &nbsp;The Major Crimes Clause undoubtedly reflects their judgment that the very integrity of this new nation could be threatened if major crimes could be committed with impunity in any part of the nation, with nat'l gov't forced helplessly to stand aside. &nbsp;<A href="../decisions/vol2/2fsm053_060.htm"><I><U>Tammow v.
