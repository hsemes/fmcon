For example, one could conclude that Mr. Phillip was a victim of events and should not now be made to suffer simply because he did not confront Mr. Perman and reassert his own rights until Peter Perman and Mr. Phillip's daughter were divorced. Counsel for the Authority also testified that the vast majority of the 400 to 500 lessees of public land have violated provisions of their leases, yet only three or four revocations have occurred. &nbsp;In light of that information, one could reasonably conclude that it would be unfair now to revoke Mr. Phillip's lease or to deny his request for renewal.</FONT></div>

                            Section 8 of the Ponape Public Lands Act of 1976, as amended, requires "public notice of the date, time and place" of a forthcoming Board meeting "to be broadcast on the broadcast station projected to reach the greatest number of people in Ponape District." &nbsp;The Act does not expressly require the notice to specify the purpose of the meeting. &nbsp;No evidence has been presented in this case as to the contents of the general radio notice which the Board provided. &nbsp;Since the method of notice to Feliciano Perman is found to be constitutionally inadequate, I need not consider whether the contents of the notice would have been sufficient to alert him to the fact that the Board would consider renewal of Mr. Phillip's lease at the meeting.&nbsp;<strong><A href="#5a"><EM>Back to

This statute, formerly a Trust Territory statute, continues in effect by virtue of the Constitution's transition provisions. &nbsp;FSM Const. art.
